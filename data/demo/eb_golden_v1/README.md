# Electric Barometer Golden Demo Dataset (eb_golden_v1)

This dataset is the **canonical demo and onboarding dataset** for the
Electric Barometer (EB) ecosystem.

It is intentionally small, deterministic, and synthetic, designed to
exercise EB concepts (contracts, observability, structural zeros, future
scaffolding) without relying on proprietary or brand-specific data.

---

## What this dataset IS

- A **panel-based, interval-level demand dataset**
- Suitable for:
  - Quickstarts and tutorials
  - CI / integration tests
  - UX and API validation
- Deterministic and reproducible (seeded generator)
- Fully public and safe to publish

---

## What this dataset is NOT

- NOT a benchmark dataset
- NOT representative of any real brand, restaurant, or menu
- NOT intended to reflect real-world volumes or performance
- NOT suitable for model accuracy claims

---

## Structure

- Interval granularity: **30 minutes** (INTERVAL_30_INDEX = 0–47)
- Multiple stores and forecast entities (commodities)
- Generic entity names (e.g., `BEEF_PATTY`, `CHICKEN_STRIPS`)
- No brand-specific or proprietary terminology

---

## Observability & Future Scaffold

- **Historical periods**
  - IS_DAY_OBSERVABLE = True
  - Intervals mostly observable, with rare missingness
- **Structural zeros**
  - Closed periods use DEMAND_QTY = 0
  - IS_STRUCTURAL_ZERO = True
- **Future periods**
  - DEMAND_QTY is missing
  - IS_INTERVAL_OBSERVABLE = False
  - Intended for forecasting, not learning

This explicitly separates:
- known vs unknown demand
- observability vs non-observability
- structure vs noise

---

## Source of Truth

- This dataset is generated by:
  `scripts/make_demo_eb_golden_v1.py`
- The generator script is the authoritative source.
- The CSV artifact should not be edited by hand.

---

## Intended Use

This dataset exists to make the Electric Barometer system:
- easier to learn
- easier to test
- harder to misuse

If this dataset breaks, **the EB user experience is broken**.
